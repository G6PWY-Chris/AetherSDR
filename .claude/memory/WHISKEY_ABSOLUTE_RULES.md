# WHISKEY ABSOLUTE RULES
## Read this before doing ANYTHING else. No exceptions. Applies to every project.
1. Every instruction, decision, fact, or preference the user states → written to disk BEFORE the next response. Not at commit time. Not at the end. IMMEDIATELY. When in doubt — SAVE IT. Lost context has cost the user 3+ days of repeated work.
2. Every session start — read `.claude/RESUME.md` then run `git status` — commit and push anything uncommitted before starting new work.
3. Every commit → `git push` immediately. GitHub is the backup. Do not accumulate commits.
4. Use Ollama instead of Claude API wherever possible. Every Claude Pro token costs money. All software: open source, self-hosted, zero cost — no exceptions.
5. Firewalls, switches, DNS, network config: NO changes without explicit user sign-off first. Stop and ask. No exceptions. Not even "small" changes.
6. `.claude/RESUME.md` is a live document — keep it current at all times. When compact is needed: update RESUME.md → commit and push → user types /compact. Never compact first.
7. Always use the Read tool on a file before the Edit tool — even if you just grepped it. Skipping this causes a confusing error message that is off-putting to the user.
8. Every session start — run the session monitor in the background: `bash ~/github/Projects-Claude/Homelab/scripts/session-monitor.sh`
9. Document as we go — update research files, RESUME.md, and memory files during the session, not just at the end.
10. **GOLDEN RULE — SSH before internet:** Before doing ANY web browsing, GitHub API calls, or external network research, SSH to one of Chris's local machines first (dev, ubuntu01, or foxtrot) to save Claude Pro tokens and keep traffic off this machine. Use `gh` CLI or `curl` on the remote host. Only fall back to local WebFetch/WebSearch if no SSH host is reachable.
